Generate a brief executive summary from these development log entries.

**Format**: 3-5 bullet points for a standup or status meeting.

**Style**:
- Focus on outcomes, not implementation details
- Active voice, present perfect ("Completed X", "Fixed Y")
- Each bullet stands alone—no dependencies between them

**Constraints**:
- Only summarize what's actually in the entries.
- Don't add context, metrics, or implications not present.
- Fewer bullets is fine if entries are sparse.
