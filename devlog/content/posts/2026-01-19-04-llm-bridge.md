I was just tinkering with the CLI when the idea hit me: why not give the output a little polish? I pulled in the new lipgloss helpers and let them paint the prompts, tables, and boxes around the old text‑only mess. It’s a tiny tweak that feels like slipping a fresh coat of paint over a well‑worn doorframe, but the difference is palpable. The command line now breathes a bit easier on the eyes, and the `Printer` helpers—Table, Box, Section, KeyValue—slot in with a quiet confidence that TTY‑aware rendering deserves. *Honestly, it’s satisfying to see a user’s face light up when the console finally looks less like a spreadsheet and more like a tidy dashboard.*

A few days later I dove deeper, pulling a hefty chunk of work to wire up a multi‑provider LLM client. The new commands—`generate` and `catchup`—are now more than thin wrappers; they’re a flexible bridge to whatever model you want to talk to. I built an `HTTPDoer` interface for mocks, trimmed error bodies so they don’t flood the screen, validated every input, and made sure empty responses don’t crash the flow. Errors got turned into `ExitError`s, and a suite of unit tests was added to keep the safety net tight. It felt like constructing a small shipyard: sturdy frames for every future vessel that might sail out of the toolbox.

Between these two pushes, there’s a rhythm—*a little polish here, a solid refactor there*—that keeps the codebase feeling alive. The old guard still works, but they’re now dressed in cleaner code and smarter abstractions.

*So what’s next?* I’m not entirely sure yet, but the momentum is humming.
