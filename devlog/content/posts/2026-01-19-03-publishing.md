Added a `just prompt` recipe that pipes timbers output straight into Claude. Command substitution does the heavy lifting—no more copy-paste gymnastics or trying to remember which flags go where. It defaults to Haiku because these reports don't need the heavy artillery, and **burning Opus tokens on formatting JSON feels wrong**.

The workflow now: `just prompt` and you get a dev blog post. That's it. One command.

This came out of writing the previous batch of docs, where I kept manually shuttling text between the terminal and the LLM. Felt dumb every time. The friction was low but *constant*, and constant friction compounds into "I'll do it later" debt.

Also shipped a hefty documentation update that finally says the quiet part out loud: **timbers exists so humans can actually understand what AI-assisted development is doing**. The whole "vibe engineering" angle—you're not micromanaging the agent, you're setting direction and then reading the ledger to see if it stayed on course.

The new `publishing-artifacts.md` doc walks through GitHub Actions patterns for auto-generating these reports in CI. The idea is simple: every PR gets a human-readable narrative artifact attached. Reviewers can read prose instead of raw diffs. Works especially well when the agent touched a dozen files to thread some feature through the stack—**the diff is accurate but illegible, the report is the actual review surface**.

Included model recommendations too. Haiku for report generation, Sonnet when you want more narrative depth. Opus if you're feeling fancy or the workset is genuinely complex. Most of the time Haiku is fine.

The README reframe matters more than it sounds. Positioning this as an *oversight tool* rather than just a logging system changes how people think about adoption. You're not adding bureaucracy, you're adding **legibility** to a process that would otherwise be a black box.
