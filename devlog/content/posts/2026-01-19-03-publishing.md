You know that moment when a tiny flag feels like a miracle? I was staring at a Claude‑generated report and thought, *why not just shove the whole timber output straight into it?* So I cooked up a one‑liner that wraps the timber command in a command substitution and hands it to `claude -p` with a default haiku. It’s a **tiny tweak** that turns a multi‑step manual dance into a single, satisfying click. No more hunting through flags, no more copy‑pasting gibberish—just `$(timber generate)` and you’re done. The code lives in a tiny shell snippet, but the payoff is a whole **streamlined workflow** that keeps the mind relaxed and the output crisp.

While I was at it, I realized the *real* story isn’t just the script—it’s the whole ecosystem around it. Human oversight, publishing, CI/CD pipelines, the works. I dove into the README and added a fresh **vibe‑engineering** section, plus a new `publishing-artifacts.md` that walks you through a minimal GitHub Actions workflow. I tossed in a few model recommendations, because who doesn’t love a good suggestion when you’re already deep in the docs? It felt like polishing a gemstone: each facet catches a different light, but the whole thing shines brighter for it.

There’s something oddly satisfying about watching a modest refactor ripple outward—tiny changes that ripple into a larger, more coherent narrative. It’s the kind of quiet satisfaction that makes me grin and whisper *yes* to myself, even if no one else is listening. *I love when the code talks back*.

That’s it for now—just a couple of modest moves that made the whole process feel a lot less like wrestling with a beast and more like chatting with an old friend.  

*— transparent about changes*
