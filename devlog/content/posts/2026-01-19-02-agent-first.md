The last week was all about **closing the onboarding gap**. The tool worked, but getting someone from zero to productive—especially an agent—was still too much friction.

I shipped an 8-part tutorial covering everything: installation, how to backfill an existing repo without losing your mind, daily workflow, agent integration, querying the ledger, generating LLM reports, human uses, and the inevitable troubleshooting section. It's the kind of doc I wish I'd written a month ago. Step-by-step, no assumptions, grounded in real scenarios.

The agent onboarding piece got its own attention. `timbers prime` now spits out workflow instructions—concrete steps agents can follow to integrate the ledger into their loop. Added an override mechanism so you can customize the output without forking. Also built a proper `uninstall` command that cleans up the repo hooks and optionally removes the binary. Turns out "how do I get rid of this?" is a legitimate question, and pretending it's not is user-hostile.

README got a full rewrite. Old version was feature soup. New one leads with the problem: *you're doing work, context evaporates, six months later nobody knows why*. Then the solution. Problem/solution framing isn't novel, but it works because it's true.

The bigger chunk of work was making **logging feel effortless**. Added an auto mode that parses commit messages and pulls out what/why/how without making you type it twice. Batch mode groups commits by work-item using beads trailers or falls back to date ranges. The goal is obvious: if documenting takes more than a few seconds, you won't do it.

Also added a `prompt` command with 8 built-in templates. Feed it your ledger entries and get LLM-ready output formatted for reports, summaries, blog posts, whatever. Template resolution walks a chain so you can override globally or per-project. It's the kind of plumbing that's invisible when it works and infuriating when it doesn't, so I made sure it works.

The whole batch touched a lot of surface area—CLI affordances, documentation, LLM integrations—but it all pointed at the same thing: **make the tool disappear**. The less you think about the ledger, the more useful it is.
