You know that moment when the **docs finally stop feeling like a chore** and start actually guiding you? That’s where we landed after a few late‑night pushes. First up, we built an 8‑part tutorial that walks you through installation, batch catch‑ups, daily workflows, and even how to hook the agent into your own pipelines. It’s not a dry manual — it reads like a conversation with a teammate who’s already walked the path, so new users can jump in without hunting for clues.

Then there’s the agent side of things. We polished the onboarding flow, added clear workflow instructions, and made uninstall a clean removal (you can even drop it as a binary if you like). The README got a rewrite that frames the whole thing as a problem‑solution story, so anyone reading instantly gets why the tool matters. It feels like we finally gave the agent a proper introduction rather than a half‑baked cheat sheet.

And because we love a good prompt, we overhauled the logging and added eight built‑in LLM prompt templates. Now you can auto‑extract work items from commit messages, batch them by bead trailers or dates, and fire off a `prompt` command that spits out ready‑to‑use reports. *It’s like having a tiny assistant that knows exactly what you need to document.* The result is smoother reporting and less manual copy‑pasting — something we all wanted but never quite got around to building.

All this feels like a modest evolution rather than a massive overhaul, but the impact is clear: onboarding is smoother, uninstall is painless, and the documentation actually *helps* instead of just describing. We’re moving from “here’s a list of commands” to “here’s how you solve real problems,” and that shift is what makes the whole stack feel alive.
