I've been thinking about the stuff that disappears. Not code—that's in Git. The *why*. The reasoning behind a refactor. The three things you tried before the thing that worked. All those breadcrumbs you leave yourself in a session that evaporate the moment you close the terminal.

**Timbers is a Git-native development ledger** that captures what/why/how as structured records. Think `git notes` meets a developer journal, but machine-readable and actually useful.

Started with the spec. Not because I love process, but because I wanted to know what this thing *was* before building it. Dialectical refinement—wrote the vision, poked holes in it, rewrote it. The spec includes an agent DX guide because if AI tools can't use this, what's the point? They're already half my workflow.

Built the guts next: a clean Git exec wrapper, a notes layer on top, entry schema with validation. The core commands are `status` to see what's uncommitted, `pending` to stage entries, `log` and `show` to read them back. Simple loop. The CLI uses Cobra with Charmbracelet styling because life's too short for ugly terminal output.

Then came the actually interesting part: **making the ledger queryable**. Tag filters, time ranges, JSON and Markdown export. The goal is pipeline-friendly—pipe entries into `jq`, feed them to scripts, whatever. I added `prime` to inject session context and `skill` to make timbers self-documenting for agents. Notes subcommands for sync operations.

The whole thing clicked when I realized the ledger is *already structured data*. Not prose you have to parse. Not markdown you squint at six months later wondering what "refactored the thing" meant. Actual what/why/how in fields you can search and transform.

It's opinionated—entries are immutable, anchored to commits, stored in `git notes` refs. If you hate that, this isn't for you. But I'm tired of tools that let you "organize things however you want" and then punish you for every choice. This one has a shape.

Three worksets, foundation to features. It works. I'm using it to write this.
