Spent the day doing what amounts to spring cleaning, a release, a coaching rewrite, and then building a whole landing page. One of those days where you look at the commit log afterward and wonder how it all fit.

The most interesting piece was the coaching rewrite. Timbers has a system prompt — a Go string constant — that guides LLMs when they're generating entries. It had accumulated 11 instances of `MUST` and `CRITICAL` in all-caps, which is the prompt engineering equivalent of bolding every word in an email. The Opus 4.6 prompt guide confirmed what I'd been suspecting: **explaining *why* a rule exists lets the model generalize correctly, while imperative shouting causes overtriggering.** So I rewrote every rule to include its motivation, replaced the yelling with calm framing, added a concrete 5-point checklist for when to include `--notes`, and wrapped sections in XML tags.

> The fun part: three different mental models (generic improvements, Opus-specific tuning, pragmatist "don't touch what works") all converged on the same answer. The problems were clarity problems, not model problems. Good coaching *is* Opus-optimized coaching.

That became v0.9.0. Right before it, v0.8.0 shipped with the `--notes` flag that had been built but barely documented — the README, tutorial, spec, and agent-reference all still showed the old what/why/how-only pattern. Five docs updated, consistently framing `why` as the verdict and `notes` as the journey to get there.

The example artifacts got a full regeneration too, and this is where notes really proved their weight. Old examples came from 30 backfilled entries with shallow `why` fields. The new set draws from 55 real entries with genuine deliberation context. The decision log went from 9 ADRs (mostly thin) to 6 ADRs where every one has a real fork-in-the-road story. **ADR-4 on the registry pattern actually quotes from entry notes — first time notes have visibly enriched template output.** Fewer entries, dramatically better signal.

Then there was a CI yak-shave. The devblog workflow was fetching git notes refs that don't exist anymore (Timbers moved to `.timbers/` directory storage ages ago), and `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes don't fire `on:push` workflows — so devblog posts were publishing but never triggering the Hugo rebuild. Fixed with a `workflow_dispatch` chain and a committed-gate. Also switched the devblog from weekly to daily because, well, the commit frequency earned it.

The `TestCommitFiles` fix was a quiet satisfaction. The test was running against live `HEAD`, which works great until `HEAD` is a merge commit and `diff-tree` returns empty. Classic "works on my machine, flakes in CI" situation. Made the test create its own temp repo with two commits so it always owns its own state. Small fix, big reliability win.

And then — a landing page. Entire.io's launch lit a fire under positioning. Did Evil Martians devtool landing page research, confirmed the usual patterns (dark mode, centered hero, terminal blocks, no enterprise-speak), and built a custom Hugo `layouts/index.html` with Tailwind Play CDN and GSAP ScrollTrigger. PaperMod stays for blog and examples; the homepage gets its own thing. **Positioned intentionally opposite to Entire.io: deliberate documentation vs. automatic session capture.** Followed up with polish passes on terminal block alignment, continuation indents, and swapping a placeholder example for a real storage-pivot entry. The kind of pixel fussing that separates "I built a page" from "I'd actually show this to someone."
