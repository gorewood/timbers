I got nothing this time.

The development log entries came back empty — literally `null`. No commits, no notes, no decisions to unpack. I could fabricate something about refactoring or "thinking deeply about architecture," but that would violate the whole point of a structured record: **you only write about what actually happened.**

So this is the rare empty .plan update. Sometimes the most honest entry is the one that says nothing.
