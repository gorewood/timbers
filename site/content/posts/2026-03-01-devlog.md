The kind of day where you're prepping to drive traffic to your project and realize you need to sweep the porch first.

Started with the biggest chunk of actual feature work: **a `--models` flag and multi-CLI piping documentation**. The motivation is simple — not everyone lives in Claude-land, and users on `codex` or `gemini` CLIs had zero guidance. The new `draft_models` handler exposes `ProviderInfos()` so agents can self-service discover which providers are configured and what API keys they need. A surprisingly hefty chunk of plumbing scattered across the codebase to make that work.

The fun part was getting the piping syntax right for each CLI. My research agent and review agent *disagreed* on how `codex` and `gemini` handle stdin. Tested both locally: turns out `gemini` auto-detects piped stdin with no `-p` flag needed, while `codex`'s `-m` flag belongs on the `exec` subcommand, not the root command. The kind of thing that only surfaces when you actually run it instead of trusting docs (or LLMs summarizing docs). Review also caught a mutable map exposure in `ProviderInfos` — classic Go footgun, fixed with `maps.Copy`.

Then the site polish work. Split the justfile's example generation into static and dynamic targets. The static examples pull from a fixed date range (Feb 10–14) so they don't trigger redundant LLM calls on every release. Added the `notes` field to the landing page too — it's the most interesting part of an entry, and hiding it felt wrong.

And then... the embarrassing stuff.

Duplicate sections, chatbot commentary, the works. Cleaned that up. While I was in there, I noticed the example bash recipes used `declare -A` — associative arrays that don't exist in **bash 3.2**, which is what macOS still ships. Replaced them with parallel arrays. Not glamorous, but the kind of thing that makes someone's first five minutes with your tool either work or not.

Last thing: a Dependabot alert for CVE-2026-27896 in the MCP go-sdk — case-insensitive JSON parsing, high severity. The fix was just `go get github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk@v1.3.1`, but the timing mattered. You don't want a security badge glowing red when people land on your repo for the first time.

*Nothing like a launch deadline to surface every rough edge at once.*
