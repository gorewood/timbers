The devblog generation pipeline was producing *apology posts*. That's the kind of bug that makes you laugh and then immediately want to fix it. When no devlog entries existed for a cycle, the workflow still invoked the LLM, which — being a polite language model with nothing to say — generated posts that were basically "sorry, nothing happened this week!" Ten of these had accumulated. *Ten blank apology posts sitting in the repo like little monuments to automation without guard rails.*

The fix is obvious in hindsight: **check if there are entries before asking anyone to write about them**. Added a count check step early in `devblog.yml`, gated the generate/commit/push stages on count > 0, and deleted the ten ghosts. This touched a fair number of files across the workflow but the logic is dead simple. Cheaper and cleaner than teaching the model to gracefully refuse — just don't call it.

The stale anchor bug was the real work this cycle. Real users were hitting confusing behavior after squash merges — the anchor commit timbers tracks would point at something that no longer exists in the branch history, and the error handling around that was... not great. The `prime` command's `gatherPrimeContext` had a bug in how it handled `ErrStaleAnchor`, and the warning messages in both CLI and MCP were unhelpful.

I went back and forth on whether to build an explicit `anchor-reset` command. Ended up deciding that **actionable warnings plus coaching are enough** — if the messaging clearly tells you *what happened* and *what to do*, self-healing behavior makes a dedicated command unnecessary. Added a stale-anchor coaching section to the prime workflow docs, improved the warning copy in both interfaces, and synced the MCP's `defaultWorkflowContent` to match. Shipped it as v0.10.2 because people were hitting this *now*.

Two smaller things rounded out the day. Added `govulncheck` as a Go tool dependency with its own `just vulncheck` recipe. It's deliberately separate from `just check` — stdlib vulnerability patches lag behind and I don't want vuln noise blocking the regular lint/test cycle. `golangci-lint` doesn't bundle it, so it needs to live on its own.

And the landing page version badge? It had drifted **two releases behind** because it was manually maintained. A `sed` step in `just release` now updates the version in `index.html` automatically. The kind of thing that takes thirty seconds to automate and saves you from looking sloppy forever.
