# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Added `govulncheck` as a Go tool dependency with `just vulncheck` recipe for vulnerability scanning
- Added automatic landing page version update during `just release`
- Added generation capability check to `timbers doctor` with CLI/API key detection via `llm.APIKeyEnvVars()`
- Added `just examples` recipe to justfile

### Changed
- Renamed `exec-summary` template to `standup` for better discoverability
- Rewrote `pr-description` template (v4) to focus on intent and decisions rather than diff review
- Updated prime workflow coaching to recommend pipe-first generation defaults for subscription users

### Fixed
- Fixed devblog workflow generating empty "apology" posts when no entries exist by adding entry count check before LLM invocation
- Fixed terminal colors invisible on dark backgrounds (e.g., Solarized Dark) by replacing hardcoded `lipgloss.Color` with `AdaptiveColor` across all output formatting


## [0.10.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Fixed `timbers prime` treating stale anchor as fatal error after squash merges — now handles `ErrStaleAnchor` gracefully like `pending` and MCP already do
- Improved stale anchor warning messages in CLI and MCP to be actionable: explains that squash-merged branches with timbers entries are already documented, advises against catch-up logging, and notes that the anchor self-heals on next `timbers log`
- Synced MCP `defaultWorkflowContent` with CLI version — MCP had a stale 4-line checklist instead of the full coaching content

### Added
- Added `<stale-anchor>` coaching section to prime workflow, guiding agents through the correct response when anchor commits are missing from history after squash merges

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-16

### Changed
- Regenerated site examples and devblog from 69-entry ledger, replacing stale content from v0.9.0
- Added provenance note to agent DX guide subtitle crediting pattern origins
- Updated landing page to v0.10.0 with terminal indentation fix

### Fixed
- Removed `PostToolUse` hook that fired but whose stdout was not surfaced by Claude Code — `Stop` hook already covers the same case via `timbers pending` at session end

### Technical
- Added retired event cleanup list for graceful hook removal on upgrade


## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- Added `--color` flag (`never`/`auto`/`always`) as a global persistent flag for terminal color control, fixing invisible text on Solarized Dark and other non-standard themes — all `NewPrinter` call sites plumbed through `useColor(cmd)`
- Added auto-commit in `timbers log` — entry files are now staged and committed atomically using `git commit -m "timbers: document <id>" -- <path>`, eliminating the gap where `.timbers/*.json` files were staged but never committed
- Added `<content-safety>` coaching section to prime workflow warning agents not to include PII, secrets, or sensitive data in ledger entries
- Added marketing landing page for Hugo site homepage with dark theme, terminal-styled code blocks, and GSAP ScrollTrigger animations

### Fixed
- Fixed `PostToolUse` hook to read JSON from stdin instead of empty `$TOOL_INPUT` environment variable, which was always empty and made the post-commit reminder a no-op since creation
- Fixed landing page terminal block alignment, continuation indentation, and quick start container width

### Technical
- Added legacy hook detection and upgrade logic via `hasExactHookCommand` and `removeTimbersHooksFromEvent` for replacing stale hooks automatically
- Added daily devblog automation at 9am UTC with workflow_dispatch chain to pages deploy

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- Rewrote agent coaching text with motivated rules — each instruction now explains *why* it exists, enabling models to generalize correctly instead of overtriggering on imperative language
- Replaced 11 instances of MUST/CRITICAL/MANDATORY with calm, motivated framing — when everything is critical, nothing is
- Replaced vague `--notes` guidance ("use when you made a real choice") with concrete 5-point trigger criteria: 2+ approaches evaluated, obvious approach rejected, surprise encountered, future lock-in, non-obvious to teammates
- Structured coaching with XML section tags (`<protocol>`, `<why-coaching>`, `<notes-coaching>`, `<commands>`) for cleaner model parsing
- Deleted redundant "Core Rules (MANDATORY)" block that restated instructions already covered above
- Updated tutorial: added `decision-log` to template list, recommended install script over `go install`, updated model recommendations to recommend `opus` for quality content

### Fixed
- Fixed Hugo site `baseURL` from `rbergman.github.io` to `gorewood.github.io` after org migration
- Fixed devblog CI workflow failing on stale `git fetch refs/notes/timbers` — timbers uses `.timbers/` directory storage, not git notes
- Fixed devblog posts not triggering site rebuild — `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes don't fire `on:push` workflows, added explicit `workflow_dispatch` chain from devblog to pages workflow

### Technical
- Switched devblog CI from weekly to daily schedule (9am UTC, `--since 1d`)
- Regenerated all site example artifacts from 55 real ledger entries with notes, replacing old 30-entry backfilled set

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Added `--notes` flag to `timbers log` for capturing deliberation context — the journey to a decision, distinct from `--why` which captures the verdict
- Added notes coaching to `prime` output with BAD/GOOD examples teaching "thinking out loud" style over mechanical summaries
- Added `AgentEnv` interface with registry pattern for agent-environment-neutral integrations, enabling single-file additions for new agent environments (Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex)
- Added `ClaudeEnv` as reference implementation of `AgentEnv`, wrapping existing Claude Code setup/teardown functions

### Changed
- Refactored `init`, `doctor`, `setup`, and `uninstall` commands to iterate `AllAgentEnvs()` instead of hardcoding Claude-specific logic
- Replaced `--no-claude` flag with generic `--no-agent` (deprecated alias preserved for backward compatibility)
- Tightened `--why` coaching to explicitly differentiate from `--notes`: why is the verdict, notes is the journey
- Preserved backward-compatible JSON keys (`claude_installed`, `claude_removed`) while generalizing step names and flags

### Fixed
- Fixed `TestCommitFiles` to use an isolated temp repo instead of live HEAD, which fails on merge commits where `diff-tree` returns empty
- Fixed `TestRepoRoot` to be worktree-compatible by replacing hardcoded directory name assertion with absolute path check

### Technical
- Extracted `defaultWorkflowContent` to `prime_workflow.go` to stay under 350-line file-length lint limit
- Extracted `outputPrimeRecentWork` from `outputPrimeHuman` to stay under cognitive complexity limit of 15
- Added `AgentEnvState` slice pattern for `uninstall` to gather and remove all detected environments

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Added MCP server with 6 tools (`pending`, `prime`, `query`, `show`, `status`, `log`) over stdio transport via `timbers serve` subcommand, enabling integration with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and other MCP-compatible editors
- Added `idempotentHint` annotation to MCP read tools, allowing clients to optimize with caching and retry logic

### Changed
- Updated `timbers onboard` snippet with `command -v` guard and install URL for graceful degradation when timbers is not installed
- Replaced all git notes references across documentation with `.timbers/` file-based storage

### Fixed
- Filtered ledger-only commits from `GetPendingCommits` to resolve chicken-and-egg problem where `.timbers/` entry commits were always reported as undocumented

### Technical
- Moved filter functions to `internal/ledger/` for sharing between CLI and MCP server
- Added `git.CommitFiles()` using `diff-tree` and expanded `GitOps` interface with `isLedgerOnlyCommit` helper
- Added `validateLogInput` to catch empty strings that the MCP SDK's required-field check does not


## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Pivoted storage from git notes to flat directory files (`.timbers/<id>.json`), enabling atomic writes and eliminating merge conflicts in concurrent worktrees
- Simplified `GitOps` interface from 8 methods to 4 (`HEAD`, `Log`, `CommitsReachableFrom`, `GetDiffstat`)
- Adopted `YYYY/MM/DD` directory layout for `.timbers/` entries to scale beyond flat-directory limits at high commit volumes
- Replaced `ReadDir` with `WalkDir` for recursive entry discovery across date-bucketed directories
- Rewrote `uninstall` command to clean up `.timbers/` directory with recursive cleanup

### Removed
- Removed all git notes code and references (`notes.go`, `notes_configured`, `remote_config` fields, `timbers notes push/fetch` commands)

### Technical
- Migrated 37 existing ledger entries from git notes to `.timbers/` flat files
- Extracted `atomicWrite` helper using temp-file-plus-rename pattern for crash-safe writes
- Added 14 integration tests proving file-per-entry storage is inherently merge-safe across branches


## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Multi-event Claude Code hooks covering the full session lifecycle: `SessionStart`, `PreCompact`, `Stop`, and `PostToolUse`
- Upgrade path that preserves existing hooks when adding new reinforcement points

### Changed
- Expanded hook configuration from single `SessionStart` hook to four reinforcement points, addressing 0% compliance for undocumented commits with single-hook approach
- Generalized hook management via `timbersHookConfig` slice with `addTimbersHooks`/`removeTimbersHooks` functions


## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

- Rewrote Claude Code hook integration from shell scripts to JSON settings, fixing session-start context injection that previously had 0% adoption due to format mismatch
- Renamed `internal/prompt` package to `internal/draft` to match the `draft` command name
- Updated agent DX guide with v0.3+ learnings, JSON hook format documentation, and shell-script anti-pattern section

### Fixed

- Added graceful degradation when `timbers` is not installed — Claude Code hook now warns with install URL instead of erroring, unblocking adoption for team members without timbers
- Added `isTimbersPrimeCommand()` for backward-compatible detection of both legacy shell-script and new JSON hook formats

### Removed

- Removed legacy `.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.sh` shell script hook in favor of JSON settings
- Removed `history/` artifacts from version control


## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Added `git.InitNotesRef()` to create an empty notes namespace during `init`, so `prime` works immediately without requiring a manual first note
- Added tests for the `prime` guard silent-exit path and `doctor --fix` auto-install path
- Added TTY-aware lipgloss style sets to `doctor` and `init` output, following the existing `uninstall` pattern
- Added `NotesRefExists` guard to `prime` to prevent no-op runs in uninitialized repos

### Changed
- Switched Claude hooks from global to project-level by default; global install is now behind the `--global` flag
- Changed git hooks from default-on (`--no-hooks` to skip) to opt-in (`--hooks` to enable), avoiding conflicts with tools like beads that rely on `pre-commit`
- Renamed `warn` style to `skip` in `init` output styles for consistency
- Renamed `gpt-5` model alias to `gpt`
- Updated `agent-dx-guide` documentation to reflect opt-in hooks and project-level defaults

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Added `--tag` filtering to `timbers query` command with OR semantics, supporting both repeated flags and comma-separated values
- Added `timbers changelog` command that generates markdown changelogs from ledger entries, grouped by tag
- Added `timbers draft` command (renamed from `prompt`) for document generation, with decision-log template in ADR format
- Added `.env.local` support for API keys via new `internal/envfile` package, loaded as fallback in root `PersistentPreRunE`
- Added cross-platform config directory support via new `internal/config` package with `Dir()` function, respecting `TIMBERS_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and Windows AppData
- Added CONFIG section to `doctor` command with checks for config dir, env files, API keys, and templates
- Added version check to `doctor` that queries GitHub releases API with graceful failure for dev builds and network errors
- Added draft status hint and stderr routing for errors/warnings when stdout is piped via `output.Printer` `WithStderr()`
- Added goreleaser configuration, GitHub Actions release workflow, and `install.sh` with checksum verification
- Added robustness for non-timbers git notes with `ErrNotTimbersNote`, schema validation, and `ListEntriesWithStats()`
- Added Configuration section to README documenting env file resolution, API key setup, and custom templates
- Added Installation section to README with `curl|bash` and `go install` methods
- Added MIT LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CI workflow for test and lint

### Changed
- Renamed `prompt` command to `draft` and propagated rename across docs, justfile, and CI
- Surfaced `draft` command in `prime` output under a new Generating Documents section
- Rewrote README for open-source audience with badges and dogfood caveat
- Updated agent DX guide with v0.2 learnings
- Fixed org owner references from `rbergman` to `gorewood` in goreleaser and install script

### Fixed
- Fixed global state issue in `status.go` by switching to closure pattern
- Fixed `amend.go` output inconsistency
- Fixed `uninstall.go` icon usage
- Fixed `ListTemplates` override bug
- Fixed piped output corruption caused by errors and warnings being written to stdout instead of stderr
