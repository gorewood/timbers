        "what": "Add .env.local support for API keys and changelog just recipe",
        "why": "Claude Code conflicts with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in environment (confuses it with OAuth); need a way to provide API keys from a file that timbers loads as fallback. Changelog recipe needed for pre-release workflow.",
        "how": "New internal/envfile package reads .env.local then .env, sets vars not already in env. Wired into root PersistentPreRunE. Added .env.example template. Updated changelog just recipe to default to opus."
