        "what": "Release readiness for v0.1.0: LICENSE, README rewrite, prompt\u2192draft rename propagation, org owner fixes, CI workflow, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING",
        "why": "Accumulated drift from prompt\u2192draft rename and missing OSS artifacts blocked a clean first release. Needed consistent naming, proper licensing, and CI before tagging v0.1.0",
        "how": "Added MIT LICENSE, rewrote README for OSS audience with badges and dogfood caveat, mass-renamed timbers prompt\u2192draft across 8 files (docs, justfile, CI), fixed rbergman\u2192gorewood in goreleaser/install.sh, added CI workflow for test+lint, wrote CHANGELOG in Keep a Changelog format, added CONTRIBUTING.md"
