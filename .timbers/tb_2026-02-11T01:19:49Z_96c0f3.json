        "what": "v0.4.0 prep: renamed internal/prompt to internal/draft, gitignored history/, updated agent DX guide with v0.3+ learnings, installed timbers on PATH",
        "why": "Package name inconsistency (command is 'draft' but package was 'prompt') would confuse contributors; history/ artifacts shouldn't be in git; DX guide needed JSON hook format docs and shell-script anti-pattern learned from v0.3 hook rewrite",
        "how": "git mv for package rename, replace_all for import/declaration updates, added concrete JSON hook example and new anti-pattern section to DX guide"
    }
