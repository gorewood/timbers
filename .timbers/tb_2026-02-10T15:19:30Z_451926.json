        "what": "Enhanced doctor with CONFIG section and version check",
        "why": "Doctor had no awareness of config dirs, env files, templates, or whether the binary was up to date \u2014 all added since the initial doctor implementation",
        "how": "Added 4 new checks (config dir, env files, API keys, templates) in a new doctor_config.go file to stay under lint file-length limit. Version check queries GitHub releases API with 5s timeout, graceful failure for dev builds and network errors."
