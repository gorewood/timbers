Moving to .timbers/ files introduced the gap but the commit step was never added. Considered separate branch (like beads/entire.io) but agent DX depends on filesystem visibility — entries must be readable by timbers prime/draft without worktree indirection. Key safety: pathspec (--) prevents sweeping other staged files into the timbers commit.","tags":["core","workflow"],"work_items":[{"system":"beads","id":"timbers-e4i"}]}
