        "what": "Graceful degradation: hook command warns instead of erroring when timbers not installed",
        "why": "Team members cloning a timbers-enabled repo without timbers installed would get hook errors at every session start, blocking adoption. The git hook already had command -v guard but the Claude Code hook did not.",
        "how": "Wrapped hook command in command -v check with friendly install URL fallback. Added isTimbersPrimeCommand() for backward-compat detection of both legacy and resilient formats. Updated DX guide with pattern."
