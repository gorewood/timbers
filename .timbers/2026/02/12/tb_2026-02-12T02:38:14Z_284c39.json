Safe default: unknown files = keep commit.","how":"Added git.CommitFiles() using diff-tree, expanded GitOps interface, isLedgerOnlyCommit helper checks all files under .timbers/, filterLedgerOnlyCommits applied to all 3 return paths in GetPendingCommits. 9 test cases across unit and filter tests."}}
