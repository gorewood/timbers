        "what": "Resolved all 5 post-v0.2.0 review findings: init creates empty notes ref so prime works immediately, renamed warn\u2192skip in init styles, renamed gpt-5\u2192gpt alias, added tests for prime guard and doctor --fix, updated agent-dx-guide",
        "why": "Three independent reviewers converged on the prime guard gap as highest priority \u2014 new users hitting silent prime after init would stall adoption. Other fixes surfaced during same review: style inconsistency, stale alias naming, missing test coverage, and docs drift.",
        "how": "git.InitNotesRef() creates empty notes namespace via git plumbing (mktree+commit-tree+update-ref), wired as new init step before remote config. Style rename and alias fix are straightforward. Tests cover both the silent-exit path and the --fix auto-install path. Agent-dx-guide updated for opt-in hooks and project-level defaults."
