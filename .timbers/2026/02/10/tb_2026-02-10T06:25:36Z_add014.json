    "summary": {
        "what": "Renamed prompt command to draft, added ADR decision-log template, surfaced draft in prime output",
        "why": "Prompt is developer jargon that undersells document generation \u2014 draft reads as the action it performs (draft a changelog, draft release notes). Decision-log template fills the biggest gap: the why-field data is uniquely suited to ADR extraction and no existing template exploited it. Prime omitted document generation entirely, causing agents to reach for export|pipe instead.",
        "how": "Changed cobra Use/Short/Long in prompt.go, updated error message and examples to reference draft. Added decision-log.md template with ADR-N format, filtering guidance for thin why-fields, and consequences section. Added Generating Documents section to prime defaultWorkflowContent with draft --list, draft for piping, and draft --model opus examples."
