    "summary": {
        "what": "Renamed prompt command to draft, added ADR decision-log template, surfaced draft in prime output",
        "why": "Prompt is developer jargon that undersells document generation \u2014 draft reads as the action it performs. Decision-log template fills the biggest gap: why-field data is uniquely suited to ADR extraction. Prime omitted document generation entirely, so agents reached for export|pipe instead of discovering draft.",
        "how": "Cherry-picked from dogfood changelog branch onto main. Changed cobra Use/Short/Long in prompt.go, updated error message and examples. Added decision-log.md template with ADR-N format. Added Generating Documents section to prime defaultWorkflowContent. Dropped the changelog command itself as redundant with draft changelog template."
