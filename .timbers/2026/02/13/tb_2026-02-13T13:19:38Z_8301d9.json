Decision log now has 6 genuine ADRs including notes-enriched registry-vs-switch deliberation."},"notes":"The decision-log improvement is the strongest showcase. Old version had 9 ADRs but most were from backfilled entries with thin why fields. New version has 6 ADRs but every one has genuine fork-in-the-road context. ADR-4 (registry pattern) includes quoted notes from the entry — first example of notes enriching template output."}
