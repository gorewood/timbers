All three converged: the problems were clarity problems not model problems. XML tags got initial 'defer' from pragmatist but overruled — the coaching is a Go string constant consumed only by LLMs, no format contract to break. Key insight from Opus prompt guide: explaining WHY a rule exists lets the model generalize correctly, vs imperative shouting which causes overtriggering."}
