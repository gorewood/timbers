        "what": "Switch Claude hooks from global to project-level, make git hooks opt-in, add lipgloss to doctor/init",
        "why": "Global Claude hook was a no-op in uninitiated repos but still ran timbers prime everywhere; git hooks conflicted with tools like beads that need pre-commit for critical operations; project-level is the natural scope since timbers requires per-repo init",
        "how": "Flipped setup claude default from global to --global flag, added NotesRefExists guard to prime, changed --no-hooks to opt-in --hooks, added TTY-aware lipgloss style sets to doctor/init following existing uninstall pattern"
